## Introduction

This Solidity smart contract, named "MyToken," provides basic functionality for managing a cryptocurrency. It includes the ability to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens. The contract is written in Solidity and is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain.

### Features

- Mint new tokens to a specified address.
- Burn tokens from a specified address, subject to a balance check.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and deploy the MyToken smart contract.

### Prerequisites

- An Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat).
- Knowledge of Solidity and Ethereum development.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeevanandps/mytoken-smart-contract.git
Usage

You can use this smart contract for various purposes, such as creating your own cryptocurrency, testing, or learning about smart contract development. Here are some example transactions:
Minting Tokens

To mint tokens and increase the total supply, use the mint function. Provide the recipient's address and the number of tokens to mint.

solidity

function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
    // Your minting code here
}

Burning Tokens

To burn tokens and reduce the total supply, use the burn function. Provide the holder's address and the number of tokens to burn.

solidity

function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
    // Your burning code here
}
